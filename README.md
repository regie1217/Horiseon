## Developing a codebase for accessibility and search engine optimization

This project is developed to improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
It is for the _"Horiseon"_ marketing agency.

The agency has provided me with a starter code. I improved the accessibility by adding alt elements to images and changing the title of the webpage so that it is more concise and descriptive. I also tried to enhance the user's experience by adding descriptive title elements to the images. The last thing that I did to improve the codebase is to make sure that the links are working.

For the CSS file, I consolidated the classes that had similar attributes and values so that it is shorter and easier to be understood by other developers who will maintain the website.

For the web designer, I would suggest separating the header element from the navigational links so that there is a clear hierarchy of elements and it would also help if the aside container had the same size or is aligned to the article container because it is more pleasant to view.

The following links are the resources that I used to complete the assignment 
(I did not use any code from these links. I just used it as a guide to clarify some terms and learn how to consolidate class selectors):
